  - This project was a game created by two other students and myself during the 2022 HackTX hackathon
  - CSS, JavaScript, and HTML were utilized to create a web game that works similar to Roobet 
  where customers of participating vendors (local restaurants, shops, etc.) can bet on a rocket and attempt to "pull out" 
  before it crashes at a random time
  - The higher the rocket travels, the higher the multiplier on the initial bet goes which gives an incentive for the customer to try to obtain the highest multiplier on their bet 
  - The goal was to implement the Solana blockchain and encourage the use of Solana as a currency to pay for items at the vendors
  - Although that hasn't been implemented fully, the plan is that the customer's wallet address would be taken and if they pulled out before the rocket crashed, 
  they would receive that money in Solana
  - Large event coordinators would use this game in partnership with local vendors to increase sales through the use of cryptocurrency
